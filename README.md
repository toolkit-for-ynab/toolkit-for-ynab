YNAB Enhanced
=============

YNAB Enhanced is a general purpose YNAB enhancing chrome extension. Have it your way!

YNAB have released an exciting new web version. Lots of power users of the older
versions are asking for options that are easily implemented in a browser extension.
Rather than ask the YNAB team to implement these features, let's just do it
ourselves!

You can do X things at the moment with this:

- Colour Blind Mode - Changes colours of some of the numbers to make the interface easier on people with certain visual disabilities.
- Make the calculator work like YNAB4. When you press + or - (etc) the calculator moves to the end of the line so your number isn't lost.
- Hide the Age of Money calculation.
- Change the height of the budget rows so you can fit more on the budget screen.
- Make credit card categories in the budget go yellow if their balance doesn't match the account balance for the card.
- Make all available amounts go red if they're negative on the budget screen.
- Make the Move money dialog larger to make more of it fit on the screen at once.

All of these are configurable with options in the extension options page.

Roadmap
-------

Features under consideration and the general status of the project is on [our Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/EzOvXlil/ynab-enhanced-roadmap). Feel free to vote, comment and suggest new features.

If you want to contribute, it's best if you can let us know so we don't double up on effort. You can see what is being worked on and by whom on the roadmap.
