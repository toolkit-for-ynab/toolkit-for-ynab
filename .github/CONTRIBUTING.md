Contributions are greatly welcomed!

### Bug Reports/Feature Requests

First, make sure the bug you're reporting or feature you're requesting hasn't
already been submitted. If you can't find the issue, submit a
[new issue](https://github.com/toolkit-for-ynab/toolkit-for-ynab/issues/new)
and follow the template that is provided.

### Contributing Code

If you want to contribute, it's best if you can let us know what you're
working on so we don't double up on effort.

You can see what is being worked on and by whom on the
[roadmap](https://trello.com/b/EzOvXlil/toolkit-for-ynab-roadmap).

If you can't find what you want to build on the roadmap, feel free to put
a note up on the github issues board to let the team know you're working
on something new.

You can find documentation on how to build features [here](https://github.com/toolkit-for-ynab/toolkit-for-ynab/blob/master/docs/building-features.md).
