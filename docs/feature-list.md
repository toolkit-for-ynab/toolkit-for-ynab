## Localization of YNAB
Localization of interface.

## Popup Calculator

Provides the same calculator capability that YNAB4 had.
* Account Screen - when adding or editing a transaction, a new button is added to the left of the 'Save and add another' or 'Save' buttons. Click the button to display the calculator.
* Budget Screen - adds a new button to the right of the value in the BUDGETED column when the sub-category is selected. Click the button to display the calculator.


## Reports
Adds a button to the side bar to access reports. Net Worth, Spending By Category, and Income vs. Expense are all available reports.

Makes the account names smaller so that you can see more of the account names and fit more on the screen.

## Better scrollbars
Provides smaller and cleaner scrollbars across the application.

## Budget Quick Switch
Adds the list of budgets to the Open Budget dropdown so you don't have to navigate to the 'Open Budget' page to switch budgets.

## Collapsable Side Menu
Adds a button that can collapse the menu on the left so you can see more of your accounts or budget data.

## Colour Blind Mode
Changes colours like red, yellow and green in the interface to colours and shapes that are more easily distinguishable by colourblind people.

## Interface Font
Select a font from the Google Fonts library.

## Hide Account Balances
Allows you to hide account type totals and/or account balances.

## Hide Help (?) Button
This feature hides the blue help (?) button in the bottom right corner of the screen. View the account-options popup (click your e-mail in the bottom left) to show or hide the help button.

## Hide Referral Banner
YNAB shows a "Share YNAB, Get YNAB free" banner. If you'd rather not see this banner, you can turn this feature on to hide it.

## Show Import Notifications in Sidebar
Display a notification in the sidebar when there are transactions to be imported.

## Navigation Tabs Height
Makes the navigation tabs (Budget, Reports, etc) smaller, and with less padding, so that you can see more of the sidebar on the screen.

## Printing Improvements
Changes print styles so budget and account sections can be easily printed. Due to the number of columns, the account section should be printed using landscape orientation.

## Privacy Mode
Obscures dollar amounts everywhere until hovered. In toggle mode, a lock icon will appear to the right of your budget name in the top left corner of YNAB. Click to enable or disable privacy mode.

## Show Intercom
It's easy to just click 'X' on the intercom announcements when they show up and forget to read what was there. This feature add an option to the account-options popup (click your e-mail at the bottom left of the screen) to show the intercom again.

## Square Negative Mode
Changes the round borders on all negative numbers to square. Helps them become more of an eyesore so you want to get rid of them!</details>
<details><summary>Budget (Click to Expand/Collapse)</summary>

## Budget Rows Progress Bars
Add progress bars and a vertical bar that shows how far you are through the month to category rows.

## Make the Categories Dropdown Larger
The Categories Dropdown that shows in the move money modal is quite small. Show more categories if the page real estate allows for it.

## Add Goals Indication
Add indicators for subcategories with goals. Types: (M)onthly goal,  target by (D)ate goal, (T)arget without date, and (U)pcoming transactions.

## Highlight all Negative Category Balances Red
Ensure all negative balances are highlighted red instead of yellow, even with credit card spending.

## Income From Last Month
Show total of incoming transactions for last month in the header. 

## Add Pacing to the Budget
Add a column for 'pacing' which shows you how much money you've spent based on how far you are through the month. Note that clicking on the pacing value will toggle emphasis, allowing you to selectively enable the feature per category.

## Remove Zero and Negative Categories When Covering Over-Budgeting
Default YNAB behaviour is to show these categories when covering overbudgeting, but since they've got no money in them they won't help you. Let's clean up the menu.

## Add Copy Transactions button to the Category Popup
Adds a button to the category activity popup to allow you to copy the transactions to the clipboard (able to be pasted into a spreadsheet app).

## Width of Category Popup
Makes the screen that pops up when you click on activity from a budget category wider so you can see more details of the transactions listed.

## Paid in Full Credit Card Assist
Highlights credit card category balances with a yellow warning if the balance of the category does not match the account balance. Adds a button to the Inspector to rectify the difference.

## Days of Buffering Metric
This calculation shows how long your money would likely last if you never earned another cent based on your average spending. We know that no month is 'average' but this should give you some idea of how much of a buffer you have. Equal to budget accounts total divided by the average daily outflow. That comes from sum of all outflow transactions from on budget accounts only divided by the age of budget in days. You can also change the number of days taken into account by this metric with the 'Days of Buffering History Lookup' setting.

## Days of Buffering History Lookup
How old transactions should be used for average daily outflow calculation.

## Display Target Goal Amount And Overbudget Warning
Adds a 'Goal' column which displays the target goal amount for every category with a goal, and a warning in red if you have budgeted beyond your goal.

## Make the Calculator Work Like YNAB4
In YNAB4, typing + or - on a budget cell meant that you didn't lose what was already in the cell. This setting restores this behaviour.

## Add "Enter" Shortcut to the Move Popup
Pressing Enter in the Move Popup acts like clicking the OK button, instead of losing focus or doing nothing.

## Goal Indicator Warning Color
Change the orange goal underfunded warning to blue, to better differentiate it from credit card overspending.

## Hide Age of Money Calculation
Hides the Age of Money calculation. Some users find it's not relevant or helpful for them, so they'd rather hide it. NOTE: YNAB will continue to run its Age of Money calculations, so the data will be up to date if you decide to show it again.

## Current Month Indicator
Changes the header bar's background color to a lighter blue when viewing the current month to better differentiate between months.

## Width of Monthly Notes Popup
Makes the screen that pops up when you click on 'Enter a note...' below the month name wider so you can add more text.

## Warn When Clicking a Quick Budget Option
When this feature is activated, there will be a warning if you have already budgeted something.

## Unhighlight all Positive Category Balances
Removes the highlight colour from positive (or zero) category balances and colours positive balances green instead.

## Allow Resizing of Inspector
Adds a button to the Budget Toolbar that allows resizing the Budget Inspector to predetermined widths of 33% (YNAB default), 25%, 20% or 15%. Note that smaller values maybe not be suitable on small screens.

## Height of Budget Rows
Makes the budget rows skinnier than the default YNAB style so that you can fit more on the screen.

## Seamless Budget Header
Remove the borders between selected month, funds and Age of Money in the budget header.

## Stealing From Future Alert
Highlights "Budget Next Month" red you've gone negative as some point in the future

## Warn When Target Balance is Not Reached
Will highlight balances of categories with Target Balances that have not yet been met.

## To Be Budgeted Warning
Changes the 'To Be Budgeted' background color to yellow if there is unallocated money left to be budgeted.

Adds a button to the Budget Toolbar to open or close all master categories at once.</details>

## First Day of the Week in Calendar
Change the first day of the week when viewing the calendar.

## Change Behaviour of Enter Key When Adding Transactions

## Clear Selection
Adds an option to the transaction edit drop-down menu to clear the current selection.

## Set Custom Flag Names (with Tooltips)
Adds the ability to set custom flag names. Tooltip for the flag name will only be visible when the cursor is hovered over the flag. *__Note__: Custom flag names are stored locally in the browser in which they are set and will __not__ be carried over to other browsers/computers. Custom flag names will be lost if browser data is cleared.*

## Emphasize Outflows
Make values in the outflow column red and put them in parenthesis.

## Larger Clickable Area for Icons
Makes the uncleared, cleared and reconciled icons easier to select.

Makes the text on reconciled transactions appear in a more obvious colour of your choosing.

## Height of Rows in Account Register
