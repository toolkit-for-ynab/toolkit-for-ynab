Add a calculation which shows how long your money would likely last if you never earned another cent based on your average spending from a chosen date range.

The actual calculation is the sum of all your budget accounts divided by the average daily outflow in the time range. Optionally, you can exclude negative credit card balances for better accuracy when carrying credit card debt.

This allows you to see how much you have available if you exclude the money "reserved" in your Credit Card Payments category group.
